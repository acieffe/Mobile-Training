# Mobile-Training
This random number generator is a way for trainers of theme park attractions to generate numbers closer to real life by weighted probability of particular party sizes. (ie parties of 3,4,6 are more likely to come up than 10, 11, 12, but those larger groups do come up) This makes training an attraction easier and more accurate.
